**what does software engineering even look like in two to three years?**
AI coding tools are getting really good, really fast and they're using Bun’s single-file executables to ship CLIs and agents that run everywhere.
If most new code is going to be written, tested, and deployed by AI agents:
- The **runtime** and **tooling** around that code become way more important.
- You get a lot more code overall, written & tested a lot faster.
- Humans are more detached from every individual line, so the environment it runs in has to be **fast and predictable**
Bun started with a focus on making developers faster. AI coding tools do a similar thing. It’s a natural fit.

Our job is to make Bun the best place to build, run, and test AI-driven software — while continuing to be a great general-purpose JavaScript runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner.
